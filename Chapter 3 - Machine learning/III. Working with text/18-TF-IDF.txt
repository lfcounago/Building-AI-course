Let's combine two tasks: finding the most similar pair of lines and the tf-idf representation.

Write a program that uses the tf-idf vectors to find the most similar pair of lines in a given data set. You can test your solution with the example text below. Note, however, that your solution will be tested on other data sets too, so make sure you don't make use of any special properties of the example data (like there being four lines of text).

This exercise requires a bit more work than average but you should be able to benefit from what you have done in the previous exercises.
