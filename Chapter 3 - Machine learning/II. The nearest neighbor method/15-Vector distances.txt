You are given an array x_train with multiple input vectors (the "training data") and another array x_test with one more input vector (the "test data"). Find the vector in x_train that is most similar to the vector in x_test. In other words, find the nearest neighbor of the test data point x_test.

The code template gives the function dist to calculate the distance between any two vectors. What you need to add is the implementation of the function nearest that takes the arrays x_train and x_test and prints the index (as an integer between 0, ..., len(x_train)-1) of the nearest neighbor.
