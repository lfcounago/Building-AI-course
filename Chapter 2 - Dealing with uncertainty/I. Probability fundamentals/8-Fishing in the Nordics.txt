Suppose we also happen to know the gender of the lottery winner. Here are same OECD statistics as above broken down by gender:
Write a function that uses the above numbers and tries to guess the nationality of the winner when we know that the winner is a fisher and their gender (either female or male).

The argument of the function should be the gender of the winner ('female' or 'male'). The return value of the function should be a pair (country, probability) where country is the most likely nationality of the winner and probability is the probability of the country being the nationality of the winner.

Output Example
if the winner is male, my guess is he's from Finland; probability 08.56%
if the winner is female, my guess is she's from Norway; probability 23.98%
